# Using These Environments

Environments are a create way to move your configuration from system to system. Here is a collection of some of the environments that I use (or have used).

To create a Conda environment using any of the files, follow the code below and replace `environment.yml` with the derised yaml file.

```bash
git clone
cd conda_envs
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
